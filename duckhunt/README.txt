1. The five ducks are included, the dirt road is drawn, the tree is in the
canvas, the bushes are drawn, and the dog is sniffing the dirt road. There
are no JavaScript errors in the console. Everything appears to be in working
order according to specification.

2. Received small help from Arlo Clarke

3. Hours spent: approx. 2 

4. File extension of README: .txt

Forgot to do -a with my commits so almost none of them actually happened which
is quite a bummer
